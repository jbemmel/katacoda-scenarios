# Connect to VNC to see IRSIM results

The web tab has an issue with the port being included in the URL upon redirect; try (and manually remove any :port )
https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8015-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/cloudtk/VNC?session=new&Tk=Irsim

CloudTk could be simplified/fixed to address this, as we are only showing a single Tcl application. As this is a Proof-of-Concept,
this is left as an exercise for the future.
