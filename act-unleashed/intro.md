# Sample online learning module

Using [Docker](https://docker.com), [CloudTk](http://cloudtk.tcl-lang.org/) and tcl [KitCreator](http://kitcreator.rkeene.org/) this
Katacoda module illustrates some possibilities for creating an online learning experience around the [ACT VLSI tools](https://avlsi.csl.yale.edu/act/doku.php)
created by [Rajit Manohar](https://csl.yale.edu/~rajit/) and team.

Through a simple exercise, we analyse a 4-stage micropipeline control circuit as [described by Sutherland](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/63526.63532)
and published in Communications of the ACM (1989).
