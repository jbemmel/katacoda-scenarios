# Creating custom maps

The online experience starts on a digital map, which can be customized.
It is configured in the .env environment file as START_ROOM_URL, and by default points to a global map at https://maps.workadventu.re/Floor0/floor0.json
(explained [here](https://workadventu.re/map-building): 
```Assuming your JSON map is hosted at "https://myuser.github.io/myrepo/map.json", then you can browse your map at 
"https://play.workadventu.re/_/global/myuser.github.io/myrepo/map.json". Here, "global" is a name of an "instance" of your map. 
You can put anything instead of "global" here. People on the same instance of the map can see each others. If 2 users use 2 different instances, 
they are on the same map, but in 2 parallel universes. They cannot see each other.```)
