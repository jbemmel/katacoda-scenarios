Education is a social, interactive experience. Let us show you how to get started creating your own online adventure:
* [Workadventu.re]( https://github.com/thecodingmachine/workadventure ) - don't be fooled by the name, they really meant "Funadventu.re"
* [Create your own school map]( https://workadventu.re/map-building )
* [Add scripts to trigger exciting events]( https://workadventu.re/map-building/scripting ) - <i>experimental!</i>
